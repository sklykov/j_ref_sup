As many other projects uploaded on Github so far - they are intended for synchronizing mine accumulated experience
of developing in different environments, project languages. Thus, I don't expect the significant popularity of
anything stated or uploaded here.
This repository contains some code examples written in Java. Hope that these examples will help me 
to develop something more valuable for the open source community.
