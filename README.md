As many other projects uploaded on GitHub so far by me, this project is intended for synchronizing my accumulated experience
of developing in different environments and languages. Thus, I don't expect the significant popularity of
anything stated or uploaded here.  
This repository contains some reference code examples written in Java. Hope that these examples will help me 
to develop something more valuable for the open source community and me. At least, they should help me to
recap basic Java programming concepts.
